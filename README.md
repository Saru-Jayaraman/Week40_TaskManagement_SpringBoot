## TODO IT APPLICATION
### Concepts:
* Java EE
* Spring Core (IoC-DI)
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Builder Design Pattern
* Lombok

### Description:
* Create a Java EE project using Spring Boot, JPA, Spring Data JPA, and Lombok frameworks. Our main goal is to reinforce what we have learned and create a solid project for future topics, especially Spring Boot REST.
* Our project is about managing tasks. Users, like admins, regular users, and guests, can see, create and modify tasks.
* We will begin by designing a class diagram to make a static view of the Todo API. Then, we will create essential classes like 'Role' and 'User' and map Java models to the database using JPA annotations.
* After setting up the data layer, we will work on the repository layer to manipulate data using the Spring Data framework.
* The primary part of our work will be in the business-logic layer, where we will design the application's operations and test them.
* Towards the end, we will do the same for the 'Person' and 'TodoItem' classes, ensuring our project remains comprehensive.
